SagePay Form Gateway for accepting payments on your WooCommerce Store.

== Description ==

SagePay Form integration is the easiest way to start processing online payments. It can take as little as 20 minutes to set up and is by far the quickest way to integrate Sage Pay.

Form integration is designed to pass transaction details from your website to Sage Pay to carry out authorisation. Outsourcing your payment processing in this way means that no sensitive data is collected, stored or transferred from your site.

This Plugin allows you to accept SagePay Payments removing the need for you to maintain highly secure encrypted databases, obtain digital certificates and invest in high-level PCI DSS compliance.
